## üìö Understanding the Pratt Parser

The **Pratt parser** is a powerful top-down parsing technique designed specifically to handle operator precedence efficiently. It allows parsing complex expressions where operators have different precedence levels and associativity rules. The **Monkey Interpreter** uses this method to evaluate expressions in the language.

### How It Works

1. **Parsing Expressions**:
   The Pratt parser works by associating parsing functions with each token type, handling different precedence levels and the structure of expressions. For example, the parser knows how to deal with infix operators like `+` and `*`, respecting their precedence, and it also handles prefix operators like `-` or `!`.

2. **Operator Precedence**:
   In an expression like `2 + 3 * 4`, the Pratt parser ensures that multiplication is evaluated first because `*` has higher precedence than `+`. The resulting parsed expression would be equivalent to `2 + (3 * 4)`.

3. **Associativity**:
   Associativity is handled properly in the Pratt parser. For example, `a - b - c` is evaluated as `(a - b) - c` due to left associativity. Similarly, for exponentiation (if supported), right associativity would ensure the expression `a ^ b ^ c` is parsed as `a ^ (b ^ c)`.

4. **Prefix and Infix Expressions**:
   - **Prefix expressions** (e.g., `-a`, `!b`) are handled by the parser as it descends through the expression tree, applying operators like negation or logical not to the appropriate expressions.
   - **Infix expressions** (e.g., `a + b`, `a * b`) are parsed by identifying the operator precedence and applying the appropriate operations as the parser processes the tokens.

### Example of Parsing

Given the expression: `-5 + 3 * (2 + 1)`, the Pratt parser will:

1. Recognize the prefix operator `-` applied to `5`.
2. Move to `+`, recognize it as an infix operator, and continue parsing the right-hand side.
3. For `3 * (2 + 1)`, it evaluates the `*` with higher precedence, and computes the result of the parenthesized expression `2 + 1` first.
4. Finally, the AST is constructed and evaluated in accordance with operator precedence and associativity.

### Advantages of Using a Pratt Parser

- **Modularity**: New operators with custom precedence can easily be added without refactoring the entire parser.
- **Clarity**: The parser remains concise and easy to understand, even when handling complex grammars.
- **Performance**: The top-down approach ensures that the parser can efficiently process input in a single pass, making it suitable for real-time applications like interpreters.
